# A dynamic CV

This is the first draft of my CV using `jekyll`, `github` and `markdown` mainly. I have began with a `jekyll` template and then fitted with `.Rmd` templates and analysis.

The first addition I have made to this is a word templated output is well. This is good for many jobs and when drafts need editing word is still the easiest pipeline for comments in many work environments.

# Make your website with R Markdown in minutes

This is a template (and tutorial) for creating your website with R Markdown in minutes.

The official document from RStudio can be found [here](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/rmarkdown_websites.html).

## Procedure

### Prerequisites

- Make sure that you have the latest versions of R, RStudio and package rmarkdown. I had problems of encoding because of that. 

- Make sure that you have enabled Git in RStudio. More information can be found [there](https://privefl.github.io/advr38book/good-practices.html#git).

- You need a GitHub account.

### Make the first version of your website

- Fork this repo (top-right) and rename it to be 'YOURGITHUB.github.io' (in Settings of your brand new repo).

- Get the link from cloning the repo. Use the green button "Clone" and make sure you use SSH, not HTTPS. Then, go to RStudio, create a New Project > Version Control > Git and copy this link. You have cloned your new repo as an R project.

- Build the website by running `rmarkdown::render_site(encoding = "UTF-8")` or just `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + B`.

- Commit and push everything from RStudio.

- Go see your new website at https://YOURGITHUB.github.io/index.html.

### Change the content of your website

- Modify `_site.yml`, `index.Rmd`, `about.Rmd`, `cv.Rmd` and `CV.pdf` with your own content. 
- Build your website again. At any moment, you can preview your website locally, by rendering your site and viewing any of your local html file in your Web Browser. 

- Commit and push everything from RStudio.

- Go see your new website with your own content at https://YOURGITHUB.github.io/.

### The blog part

For now, the 'Blog' link is giving a 404 page. 

If you want to add a static blog to your webpage, go [there](https://github.com/privefl/jekyll-now-r-template).

## Conclusion

As a reminder, all credit goes to the geniuses at RStudio (thanks also to [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/)). I just made some minor modifications and made a tuto about how to use all this together.

If anything is false or not clear enough, feel free to contact me or open an issue.
If it is an issue only related with R Markdown, you'll find a better answer posting [there](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown).

## Resources

- You may need to [install jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

- Then point your browser to [0.0.0.0:4000](http://0.0.0.0:4000).

  You can see for example 

  - [my own website](https://privefl.github.io/),

  - [the website of the R user group in Grenoble](https://r-in-grenoble.github.io/).

### Original Jekyll instructions

A `jekyll-based` markdown CV, which currently looks something like [this](http://blm.io/cv/), see this [blog post](http://blm.io/blog/markdown-academic-cv/) for details. Forked from the (great) markdown CV of [elipapa](https://github.com/elipapa/markdown-cv). 

#### How to use

To build, clone the repo and run `jekyll`:

```bash
git clone git://github.com/blmoore/md-cv
cd md-cv/
jekyll serve
```

Install instructions under resources

#### HTML version

The HTML version is generated by Jekyll under `_site` using `media/cv-screen.css`. Most changes from the original repo are artificial:

* fixed horizontal scrolling issue caused by lots of funky CSS positioning (lots of `left` etc.)
* messed with colours, fonts
* now imports font-awesome icons and Open sans
* moved `ul` into 3-col layout (iirc following [another markdown cv](https://github.com/davidhampgonsalves/resume) I tried)

#### PDF version

Note the separate CSS for print and screen media (see `media/cv-print.css`), my approach was to build a somewhat "jazzy" html version and a toned-down print version (for PDF). My changes introduce CSS3 columns in some sections which currently don't print to PDF under the `blink/webkit` engines (as of March 2015), so to print properly I suggest `firefox`.

Another problem with the PDF is pagebreaks, they're often not handled gracefully so I've added one in explicitly. Say you want a pagebreak before the section titled "education" (`h2` text is set to `id` so use unique section headers!), the print media CSS would be:

```CSS
#education {
	page-break-before: always;
}
```

A curriculum vitae maintained in plain text and rendered to html and pdf using CSS.

## Usage

To start, simply [fork the markdown-cv repo](https://github.com/elipapa/markdown-cv)

![](https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/fork_button.jpg)

and then [edit directly in github](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository/) the `index.md` file

![](https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/edit-file-edit-button.png)

adding your skills, jobs and education.

To transform your plain text CV into a beautiful looking HTML page and share it you then have two options:

## 1) Using Github Pages to publish it online

1. Delete the existing `gh-pages` branch from your fork. It will only contain this webpage. You can either use git or [the github web interface](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/#deleting-a-branch)

2. Create a new folder labeled `docs` (which will then tell github to build to)

3. Set up github-pages to publish to the docs folder

Any change you want to make to your CV from then on would have to be done on the `gh-pages` branch and will be immediately rendered by Github Pages.

## 2) Build it locally and print a PDF
1. [install jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) on your computer. `gem install jekyll` will do for most users.
2. Clone your fork on your computer
3. Type `jekyll serve` and you'll be able to see your CV on your local host (the default address is http://localhost:4000).
4. You can edit the `index.md` file and see changes live in your browser.
5. To print a PDF, just press *Print*. Print and web CSS media queries should take care of the styling.

### Change the style

The included CSS renders CV in different styles:

- `kjhealy` the original default, inspired by [kjhealy's vita
template](https://github.com/kjhealy/kjh-vita)
- `davewhipp` is a tweaked version of `kjhealy`, with bigger fonts and dates
  right aligned

To change the default style, one needs to simply change the variable in the
`_config.yml` file.

Any other styling is possible. More CSS style contributions and forks are welcome!
